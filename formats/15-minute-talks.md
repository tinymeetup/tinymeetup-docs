### Format summary

A meetup consists of 1 to 5 talks and several breaks.

Each talk has a hard limit of 15 minutes. After each session the speaker
might take questions from the audience. If that's the case it's a good
idea to put a time limit on those too.

Make breaks between sessions so people can get a snack and chat.

### When to use

It's a great format for a meetup where first-time speakers are presenting.
A well-prepared speaker will have no issues communicating their point in 15
minutes and making it interesting and engaging. If a speaker is not
prepared, well, the audience will only have to endure them for 15 minutes.

The main point of such a meetup is conversations in-between and after the
talks, not the talks themselves. The purpose of presentations is to just
"seed" those conversations.

It's also a good platform for your community to help speakers grow into
the larger conferences.

### Strengths and weaknesses

* Strengths

    * Organizers can get their focus off of the content when organizing an
      event;

    * It's a well-tested, relatively easy to start with format that works;

* Weaknesses

    * Depending on your location it might be hard to find speakers,
      especially in the beginning;

    * Depending on your location it might be hard to find a venue that has
      the necessary technical equipment;

    * It's not a very engaging format. Some people will come to see the
      talks and then leave. That's fine, just make sure that people
      that want to chat and mingle have the opportunity to do so.


### Tips

* Don't filter out speakers based on experience. On the contrary,
  encourage beginners to give a talk;

* It's a good idea to help speakers prepare. Maybe do a test run of their
  talk before the meetup (via skype on in person). That's of course will
  require some effort from the organizers or the more experienced speakers
  in the community;

* Encourage conversations in between and after the meetup. One way to do
  that is to have a buffet with snacks and drinks. Another one is to
  organize an afterparty after the main event and invite all attendees.
