## Motivation

This is a knowledge base for community organizers. Here you can find
information on topics like:

* Which formats a meetup might have;
* How to find a venue and sponsors for your events;
* How to discover and keep in touch with your community;
* How to encourage and help first-time speakers;
* …and more.

Treat this document as a table of contents.

## Requesting help or information

If there's something you'd like to get help with please [open an
issue](https://github.com/tinymeetup/tinymeetup-docs/issues/new).
We will do our best to help or connect you with someone who can do that
better than us.

What we can help with:

* Finding a venue for an event;
* Connecting you with other organizers in your area or speaking your
  language;
* Spreading the word about your meetup;
* Finding speakers for your event;
* …and more.

## Contributing

Best way to contribute is to share your experience as an organizer, a
speaker or an attendee. Consider writing an article for the knowledge base
or join the conversation in
