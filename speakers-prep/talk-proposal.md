# Writing a talk proposal

[tinymeetup docs](../README.md)

Writing a talk proposal for a meetup is usually less demanding than
writing a proposal for a conference. There are still a couple of things
that should be there:

* Name of the talk
* Short abstract for the announcement: 2-3 sentences
* Descrption of the talk for the organizers: 2-3 paragraphs
* Your name
* Your contact information
* Your social media links and/or website

If you would like to give a talk but not sure what to talk about, reach
out to meetup organizers. Trust me, it's a struggle to find people that
want to do a session and they will be happy to help you out in any way
they can, including figuring out a subject together with you.
