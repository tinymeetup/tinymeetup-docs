# Slides checklist for speakers

[tinymeetup docs](../README.md)

This is a set of best-practices for making slides. Treat those as
recommendations, not as rules that are set in stone :)

- [ ] Title slide
  - [ ] Has the name of the talk
  - [ ] Has your name and any public contact info (email, twitter, etc)
- [ ] Every slide except for the title slide has its number on it
- [ ] Code on slides
  - [ ] Is short
  - [ ] Is not a bitmapped image
  - [ ] Has a light background
  - [ ] Has syntax highlight
  - [ ] Is typed with monospaced font
- [ ] Slides do not have content that violates Code of Conduct
- [ ] Final slide
  - [ ] Has your name and public contact info (email, twitter, etc)
  - [ ] Has a single short readable link (e.g. `bit.ly/mytalk`) to a place
    with all the repos/articles/slides/demos used in the presentation.
