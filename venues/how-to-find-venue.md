## Potential places for a meetup

When looking for a place for a meetup, check out:

* Cafes and bars (preferably quiet ones)
* Co-working spaces
* Public schools and universities
* Offices of companies that work with topics you'd like to talk about


## Talking with companies

### Who to talk to about hosting a meetup

Several options:

* If the company has hosted similar events in the past, find the person
  responsible for them;

* Look for an event-manager or an HR person on LinkedIn and reach out to
  them;

* Find a person who works at the company and is interested in a meetup
  you're organizing. Ask this person to talk to people responsible for
  internal and external events (usually HR);

* If a recruiter from the target company reaches out to you, write him
  back and suggest hosting a meetup.


### How might a host company help your meetup

It depends on a company. Most can provide:

* Venue
* Help on site

Some can also do:

* Snacks
* Extra PR
* Video recording of the talks
* Swag (t-shirts, cups)
* Cover travel expences for speakers

### What can you as a meetup offer your hosts

* Recruiting possibilities:
* Recognition amongst your audience;
* One slot booked for the speakers from the hosting company.
